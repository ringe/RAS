h1. RAS blog

p. This is a simple obligatory PHP student project. We've tried to create a blog 
based on the MVC principle, partly inspired by Ruby on Rails.

h3. External components

p. We've used TinyMCE, Prototype, Scriptaculous and Smarty.

h3. Pretty URLs

p. The .htaccess or nginx rewrite rules are necessary to get pretty URLs.

h3. nginx rewrite rules

bc..        location / {
          rewrite  ^(.*)$  /index.php?url=$1  last;
          break;
        }

        location ^~ /index.php/ {
        }

        location ~* (robots\.txt|images|javascript|css|phpinfo) {
        }
