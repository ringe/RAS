= RAS blog =

This is a simple obligatory PHP student project. We've tried to create a blog 
based on the MVC principle, partly inspired by Ruby on Rails.

== External components ==

We've used TinyMCE, Prototype, Scriptaculous and Smarty.

== Pretty URLs ==
The .htaccess or nginx rewrite rules are necessary to get pretty URLs.

== nginx rewrite rules ==
        location / {
          rewrite  ^(.*)$  /index.php?url=$1  last;
          break;
        }

        location ^~ /index.php/ {
        }

        location ~* (robots\.txt|images|javascript|css|phpinfo) {
        }
